# Project overview
<br>
UniFlea is a mobile application that serves as a marketplace platform for university students. It will be exclusively available to currently enrolled students at the university with a buffer period that permits recent graduates to also participate. The goal for UniFlea is to help students purchase or sell textbooks, equipment, electronics, furniture, clothing and more. Similar to applications such as Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist, UniFlea is unique in that it offers the comfort of safety through an authentication process that confirms transactions are being made by students. Features of UniFlea include authentication and verification upon creating an account, a personalized homepage catered to the individual student, search filters and categories, in app messaging, notifications, and a moderation and reporting system.

# **Final Version Release**
Hi everyone, this is the 4th and final release of our application, UniFlea. There are many exciting features and quality of life fixes to go over.

### **New features in this release**

- Users can now see how many views an item has received and will update in real time.
- Users will only be able to view the products that have been submitted by fellow students of the same university. For example, Temple students will be allowed to see other products made by other Temple students.
- The theme of the application will now dynamically change depending the logged in user's university. For example, the theme for Temple is cherry and white and the theme for Drexel is gold and blue.

### **Quality of Life and Bug Fixes**

- Invalid email error will no longer pop up after every character change in the email field.
- Reading reviews on another person's profile will not be populated with that user's reviews and not the signed in user's.
- Report button now takes the user directly to the default email app.
- No more multiple back buttons on the other user's profile.

### **Known Bugs**
- Keyboard will cover up text input in some pages.
- Search bar functionality is case sensitive.
