# Project overview
<br>
UniFlea is a mobile application that serves as a marketplace platform for university students. It will be exclusively available to currently enrolled students at the university with a buffer period that permits recent graduates to also participate. The goal for UniFlea is to help students purchase or sell textbooks, equipment, electronics, furniture, clothing and more. Similar to applications such as Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist, UniFlea is unique in that it offers the comfort of safety through an authentication process that confirms transactions are being made by students. Features of UniFlea include authentication and verification upon creating an account, a personalized homepage catered to the individual student, search filters and categories, in app messaging, notifications, and a moderation and reporting system.

# Milestone 2 Release
<br>
New in this release is a fully functioning product filtering system. This includes filtering by searching, category, date, and price.
Furthermore, we enable users to save items they are interested in. We have also restyled the listings on the home screen to adhere to modern design principles. We also created the listing screen, allowing users to create new listings, and have them populated in the home screen's list of products.
Finally, we created the front end for the report user and add review screens, accessible via the profile screen.
