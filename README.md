# UniFlea
## Project Overview
UniFlea is a mobile application that serves as a marketplace platform for university students. It will be exclusively available to currently enrolled students at the university with a buffer period that permits recent graduates to also participate. The goal for UniFlea is to help students purchase or sell textbooks, equipment, electronics, furniture, clothing and more. Similar to applications such as Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist, UniFlea offers the comfort of safety through an authentication process that confirms transactions are being made by students. Features of UniFlea include authentication and verification upon creating an account, a personalized homepage catered to the individual student, search filters and categories, in app messaging, notifications, and a moderation and reporting system.
